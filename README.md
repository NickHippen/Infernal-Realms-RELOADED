These are the functions of the basic Minecraft GUI.

**EXP Bar** - Displays mana (for spells).

**Hunger Bar** - Used normally as it is in Minecraft - there will be custom food.

**Hearts** - Can be used to see larger fractions of your health, such as: 10 hearts = 100%

4 1/2 hearts = 45%

## Items

This is a Flaming Katana (custom item) with out its modifiers (gems socketed or enchantments).

This is a Flaming Katana with a +12 Stamina enchant and 2 gems socketed. As you can see, the socket bonus is granted.

The inventory will be fully customized with 6 slots for pouches (extra inventory space), and 6 GUI buttons to open things such as the mount shop. The first 2 slots will be used for two weapons of your choice, the 3rd slot will be any item that isn't a weapon and the rest will be utilized for spell hotkeys.

## Monsters

Here is a bandit (which looks like a walrus). As you can see, mobs will have custom names, levels and equipment.

The 14 next to their name symbolizes their level. Each mob is spawned with random armor and has a certain percentage to drop it on death.
